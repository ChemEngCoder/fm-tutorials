# 🧠 Tutorial 4: Latent Space Analysis

## Understanding and Visualizing Protein Embeddings

---

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Extract and manipulate protein embeddings from pre-trained ESM2 models
2. Reduce high-dimensional embeddings to 2D for visualization
3. Quantify clustering quality using mutual information metrics
4. Optimize dimensionality reduction hyperparameters automatically
5. Analyze how features change across different layers of a transformer model
6. Interpret latent space structure in relation to protein function
